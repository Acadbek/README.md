<p align="center">âœ¨ Hi guys, I'm Asad. I am a JavaScript developer from Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 
I have done many works with JavaScript, Vue and React. Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
